http://localhost:8080/secure/WelcomeToJIRA.jspa.
This will initially throw error since since JIRA is not actually "Setup". 
To "setup" jira, we actually open a folder ( in desktop or in any other spot of interest), get the file back and feed it to jira-application.properties txt file in 
Web-INF folder
so, it should be in  /Users/jayashreehemmige/Documents/atlassian-jira-software-8.14.0-standalone/atlassian-jira/WEB-INF/classes/jira-application.properties ( currently 
already created) .

Now, open terminal  enter this command /Users/jayashreehemmige/Documents/atlassian-jira-software-8.14.0-standalone/bin/startup.sh > go to localhost 8080 >
again hit /Users/jayashreehemmige/Documents/atlassian-jira-software-8.14.0-standalone/bin/startup.sh > go to locahost8080 to actually open JIRA. ( create USERID/PWD)


on POSTMAND use

http://localhost:8080/rest/auth/1/session in POST 
{ "username": "hemmige.jayashree", "password": "Krom123$12" } in the BODY with json.

you may either use ID obtained from http://localhost:8080/rest/auth/1/session  OR create an api token from here 
https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens ( you can revoke the API token if used) . This is basically used in Basic auth of Postman.
