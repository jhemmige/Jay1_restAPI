way to construction file :


1. Using the OAuth 2.0 Contract Details: (saved in Documents> restapi>oauth)
First, we construct the end point where we can obtain authorization URL. Refer to GETCODE URL IN POSTMAN.
Plug the getcode url into a browser 
Next, choose the email that we need to use to loginto that specific site . it leads to blank page witth a specific url is the browser. This will give out the auth code

next, use the code into exchangecode and choose HTTP request as POST and click send, this will give the access token.

Why do applications rely on other applications for authorization like Google, Facebook, linkedIn etc. 
1. No data breach 
2. No need to maintain client profile data on their server.
3. Let's say customer needs to get Hotel, Cab and flight booking, they dont need to signup multiple times across different application. Instead they can 
authorize one application for a common login. 

Parts of Oauth API - 
Client - application that needs to be served. 
Client ID- unique ID that recognizes the client which is public
Client SecretID - Private code 
resource owner is a Human
Resource/Authorization server - server that authorizes the interaction from client for eg: Google, FB


There are different types of grant type - Authorization code 
Client credentials 
Client Credentials :
0auth 2.0  is industry standards security protocol
Authorization_code has Human interaction.
Client Credentials do not have Human Interaction
Authorization code has many layers of security
Grant_type -Client_credentials if the interaction is between application and server with no users involved.
For eg: I want to bring in courses available on RahulShetty, then I don't need to use Auth code since I will be using my own resources to bring data. Bring my own data
